Usage
-----

Unzip to a blank USB thumbdrive (FAT32 formatted, 512 MB or greater, root folder, make sure you keep directory structure) - power off your activated, networked, functional chumby - insert thumbdrive - power on. Wait for the voice prompts (3-5 min) and when it reboots remove the USB thumbdrive. The first boot after install will take a while (1-2 min), the next ones are much faster. If upgrading with an on board firmware already on the Chumby the procedure is the same. The loader will detect the earlier install and upgrade it automatically. 
You will need to change the control panel time to your correct location after bootup. Also change the brightness and sound to your preference. 
Ensure your chumby is activated, on the network and fully operational with the latest firmware (c1/i3.5 - v1.0.7 or c8/i8 - v1.8.2) prior to using the offline firmware. 
Although you do not need to activate your chumby and can run this offline firmware completely without a network, for a first time installation both network and activated chumby are recommended to make life simple. For operating in network-less environments please delete the file autoreboot.on from the chumby storage root. 
NOTE: The screen may not update while the firmware is installing. This is normal. 10-15 min is the average time for the firmware to load into your chumby. Do not unplug it during firmware loading.


Factory fresh Chumby
--------------------

If your chumby is NOT on the latest factory firmware the offline firmware will not load. 
In order to get your chumby to the latest firmware follow the procedure below :
chumby One / Insignia Infocast 3.5

This firmware is for the white plastic chumby devices, with blue trim, HW version 3.x, and Insignia Infocast 3.5", HW version 7.x. The current version of the firmware is 1.0.7.

1) Get a USB flash drive, make sure it is FAT32 formatted.

http://files.chumby.com/resources/chumbyone/1-0-7/update.tgz
3) Put the flash drive into the back of your device.

USB disk problems
-----------------

The installation checks the files on the USB disk before installing to your chumby. If the files have issues such as data corruption etc the install will stop. Please replace the USB disk and try a new one or reformat the USB disk and retry it.


Help
----

Forums are available at : 

https://sourceforge.net/p/zurk/discussion/12064/

Feel free to discuss any topics as required. The chumby forums may provide more general help but they may not be available for much longer. 


Chumote!
--------

The Chumote! infrastructure has been expanded with this release. Simply point your web browser to your chumby's ip address and you should see the new infrastructure pop up. You can now see the contents of the chumby screen and set a few parameters as well as start ssh. For insecure networks ensure you set a ssh password with "passwd root" once you ssh into the chumby. 


Music 
-----

Note that chumby music infrastructure has been **REMOVED** from the offline firmware including PANDORA. You may restore chumby infrastructure and PANDORA by completing the following procedure : After booting the chumby using the offline firmware use a web browser ( firefox/chrome/IE/safari etc ) and go to http://ip.address.of.your.chumby (You can find the IP Address in the control panel -> Settings -> Device info under ip: - The 192.168.xxx.xxx is your chumby ip address ). Your chumby is automatically converted into a webserver with a web-based control and information page loaded when you boot up the offline firmware. You will see a webpage with links. Simply click the link to select chumby.com online infrastructure and pandora will be enabled. You can also disable it and run off the offline firmware provided music infrastructure by selecting the second link. You cannot run the offline firmware music infrastructure at the same time as the chumby provided music infrastructure. 


DLNA / UPnP Infrastructure
--------------------------

The file dlna.on must be deleted to disable DLNA support. By default it is enabled and can be controlled from the web control panel. Use a javascript enabled web browser to browse http://ip.address.of.chumby/dlna to access the DLNA / UPnP control panel.
Note that on first boot DLNA will NOT be available until approximately 1 hour has passed. You can check the status of DLNA by using the web control panel. 
DLNA can be used with any UPnP or DLNA music server or device. An open source cross-platform server such as MediaTomb is recommended. 


Customization - Widgets/Weather
-------------------------------

Customize widgets and weather by selecting the appropriate link for Multi Channel Widget Editor or Weather Editor from the link on the chumby web control panel. Ensure you click the reload channel link on the control panel to see your changes on the chumby. 

Weather updates are hourly. Wait up to 1 hour before assuming something has gone wrong with your changes. 


Customization - Music
---------------------

Firmwares now have a common music infrastructure built-in. You can customize the music by editing the folder : lighty/html/chumcast/list
and create the corresponding xshow file with a list of your music. This will modify the blueocty radio

You must type the following command on the chumby after you edit music on there directly : sync

You can customize the podcasts by selecting the corresponding Podcast Editor on the menu of the chumby web based control panel.


Networkless mode
----------------

Want to run your chumby without a network ? Network-less mode is for you. Delete the file autoreboot.on from /mnt/usb and your chumby will work without a network. Note that this procedure is irreversible unless you reinstall the software on the chumby using a usb disk. Until that happens the chumby will not connect to any network.


Note 
----

Once you have changed any settings to your liking, prior to putting the chumby into actual use, ensure you sync and reboot it at least once.


Guide
-----

Only obsolete guides are currently available. Documentation will be included as volunteers write it for the new embedded infrastructure.
